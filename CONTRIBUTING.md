# Issue tracker

If you came here to report a bug or suggest something related to the development/code of the mod, then you are in the right place! However, if you want to suggest a gameplay feature, you should probably do it at the [FTB forum page](http://forum.feed-the-beast.com/threads/1-7-10-rfdrills-addon-for-thermalexpansion-and-enderio.82764/) instead. This issue tracker is only intended for bugs, crashes and other development-related things.

## Writing the thing

First, you need to register your account on Github. This should be pretty easy.

Then, you have to make sure that your bug hasn't been reported already. If a bug is already solved it will appear in the [Closed issues](https://github.com/goldenapple3/RFDrills/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) section.

Finally you can actually write the thing! If you want your report to be as clear and helpful as possible, you should check out [this little website](http://vazkii.us/br101/) made by Vazkii. Your bug report doesn't have to be amazing, but the better you explain the issue, the easier it will be to fix.
