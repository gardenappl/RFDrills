#Issue tracker
If you came here to report a bug or suggest something related to the development/code of the mod, then you are in the right place! However,  if you want to suggest a gameplay feature, you should probably do it at the [FTB forum page](http://forum.feed-the-beast.com/threads/1-7-10-rfdrills-addon-for-thermalexpansion-and-enderio.82764/) instead. This issue tracker is only intended for bugs, crashes and other dev-related things.

##Writing the thing
First, you need to register your account on Github. This should be pretty easy.

Then, you have to make sure that your bug hasn't been reported already. If a bug is already solved it will appear in the [Closed issues](https://github.com/goldenapple3/RFDrills/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) section.

Finally you can actually write the thing! If you want your report to be as clear and helpful as possible, you should check out [this little website](http://vazkii.us/br101/) made by Vazkii. She did a great job on it, and it explains things a lot better than I would (totally not because if my laziness).
